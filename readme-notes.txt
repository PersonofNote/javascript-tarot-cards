Riffing off of https://medium.com/@pakastin/javascript-playing-cards-part-1-ranks-and-values-a9c2368aedbd.
Decided to try to make a Tarot flashcard app, adding in the knight,
changing the suits, and adding the Major Arcana.

I guess eventually I'll try to incorporate the meanings as well,
from some kind of external file, that you can reveal if you can't
guess the answer.
